# TimedText Parser

Parse text out of YouTube's auto-generated captions. A great way of transcribing YouTube videos automatically.

*Note: this only works with some videos. Under development.*

## Getting started

First, fire up the Jupyter notebook.

Next you need to get a TimedText URL from your YouTube video. Go to the YouTube URL, open your Developer Console, go to the Network Tab, refresh the page. Then toggle on the closed captions. Wait for a bit then filter for `timedtext` in the dev tools search bar. Copy and paste the URL you see there.

## TODOs

This doesn't currently work with [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ydp6bR5HXw) b/c the format is different:

just to live your life inside the world, try not to bash into the walls too much, try to

Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and that is that everything

around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you.
